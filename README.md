- Worked with State Key Laboratory of Mobile Communication of China. The project aim to solves the limiting factors of massive MIMO downlink transmission performance and complexity in a mobile environment. The subject extends the algorithm application scenarios to Ultra-Massive MIMO under 6G in 2022.
- Responsible for the mathematical derivation and Python program implementation of the precoding algorithm. 

### Patent

One patent is related to this work: A Machine Learning Assisted Low Complexity Linear Precoding Algorithm Based on OFDM System, 2022 (ID: 202210519716.7, at China National Intellectual Property Administration)

- The invention belongs to the technical field of massive MIMO communication.
- The invention discloses a linear precoding method based on the OFDM system, which converts the channel into narrowband sub-channels. It then selects part of the sub-carriers in both time and frequency directions to insert pilots, and estimates the channel parameters of the remaining frequencies, thereby calculate all precoding matrices.
